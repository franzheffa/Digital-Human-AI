The I/Q samples on the FH interface are in the time-domain. This setup allows for further expansion of coverage area by cascading a second O-RU to the first O-RU via the FH interface.\n\nIn contrast, in the integrated architecture, O-DUx and O-RUx are physically located in the same hardware box and there is no need for an FH interface to connect them. This type of architecture uses an open F1 interface between the O-CU and O-DUx. This notable difference simplifies the physical setup and might offer lower latencies due to the absence of a connecting interface. Therefore, the difference lies mainly in the location of the O-DUx and O-RUx and the need for an FH interface to connect them."

        "answer": "The role of the Non-RT RIC in discovering and retrieving policy type information for A1 policies involves several steps. First, the Non-RT RIC discovers A1 policy types that are available in the Near-RT RIC. This is achieved by initiating a query for policy type identifiers for A1 policy types that are available in the Near-RT RIC.\n\nOnce the policy type identifiers are known to the Non-RT RIC, it proceeds to retrieve policy type information. This can either be for a selection of A1 policy types it is interested in or for all A1 policy types available. In each scenario, it initiates an A1 policy types query and queries for information about a single policy type. The Non-RT RIC then repeats this step for either the policy type identifiers it is interested in or for all policy type identifiers. \n\nAfter these steps, Non-RT RIC has the information of multiple or all available A1 policy types which is then used to create and validate A1 policies in the Near-RT RIC."

        "question": "How do the deployment locations and cell coverage differ between the outdoor macrocell and microcell architectures?",
        "answer": "The outdoor macrocell deployment location is mainly for macro coverage in areas such as roads, buildings, open spaces, and it covers rural, semi-urban, and urban areas. It provides a consistent 5G experience along with seamless mobility. The deployment for a macrocell can include the O-DU at the cell site or at a data center and can utilize an integrated architecture. Its cell coverage is sectorized and directional with up to 16 layer MIMO; up to 64TX/64RX. \n\nOn the other hand, microcell deployment location is also outdoors but it offers different cell coverage. The cell coverage for microcell architecture is both omnidirectional and sectorized. It is designed to work with SU-MIMO/MU-MIMO; up to 16TX/16RX. \n\nHence, the main difference lies in the type of coverage \u2013 macrocell architectures provide sectorized and directional coverage for a larger area, while microcell architectures can provide both omnidirectional and sectorized coverage for smaller or confined spaces."

The physical partition method is adopted by O-RAN; hence, the base station architecture is divided into two categories namely split and integrated. In split architecture, the fronthaul interface determines the gNB functions location. Here we refer to the two partitions as O-DUx and O-RUx; where the \u201cx\u201d is split option number. In case the O- RAN WG4 defined fronthaul interface is used, these two partitions are called O-DU7-2 and O-RU7-2. For a more complete description of the terminology used, refer to the Deployment Scenarios and Base Station Classes Document [1]. The split architecture is shown in Figure 2-1. A Fronthaul Gateway (FHGW) is an optional device between the O-DUx and O-RUx to aggregate multiple radio units together. Within this specification, a Back End fronthaul interface is defined as the connection between the FHGWx and the O-DUx, while the Font End fronthaul interface is defined as the connection between the FHGWx and the O-RUx. With split architectures, one may choose to have O-CU and O-DUx as either co-located or shared configuration with respect to hardware.

Indoor Outdoor Pico Pico Micro IAB Macro 0.75-1.33Gbps (DL); 0.25-0.67Gbps (UL); NOTE1 FR1: up to 6/12 Gbps (UL/DL) FR2: up to 15/30 Gbps (UL/DL) FR1: up to 6/12 Gbps (UL/DL) FR2: up to 15/30 Gbps (UL/DL) FR2: 3-12 Gbps (DL); 1.5-6 Gbps (UL) For n260: 12-24 Gbps (DL); 6-12 Gbps (UL) FR1: up to 6/12 Gbps (UL/DL) NOTE1: This requirement is calculated based on the frame structure UL:DL=1:1 (TDD). 4.2 Peak spectral efficiency\n\nThe highest radio throughput occurs when there is high spectral efficiency and largest spectrum allocation for UEs. Typically, this occurs at quiet times when there are a small number of active UEs that is in close proximity to the radio. This is known as the Quiet Time Peak rate. As the number of UEs and distribution of UE\u2019s around the cell site increases, so the busy time mean rate is seen. This is normally significantly lower than the quiet time peak rate and is impacted by interference between radios, carriers and UEs, along with environmental factors that impact signal strength and interference such as physical location of the cell site, its surroundings and other sources of interference. In the provisioning examples shown in Table 13, busy time mean has been calculated as 30% of quiet time peak. This is applicable to 4G implementations, however at this time it is not clear whether this figure is appropriate to 5G NR. Transport engineers will need to liaise with the radio engineers to ascertain this figure for 5G environments. 10.2.4 Transport dimensioning and provisioning for Backhaul and Midhaul\n\nDifferent Telecom profiles and packet rate usage: G.8275.1 [1] o Packet rate is fixed for this profile. o 16 Sync, Delay-request and Delay-response and 8 Announce packets per second. o User cannot change the packet rate in this profile mode of operation. Both Master and Slave clocks shall be able to support and function properly with this packet rate. G.8275.2 [3] o Packet rate is configurable for this profile. o Allows up to 128 packets per second for Sync, Delay-request, Delay-Response and 8 announce packets per second. o Packet rates plays critical role based on the clock recovery algorithm used in this profile mode of operation. Note-1: Packet rate can also affect the bandwidth utilization on the link hence the network. Selecting appropriate packet rate without compromising Sync performance is critical for good network operation.  \u00a9 2023 by the O-RAN ALLIANCE e.V.

        "question": "What factors impact the busy time mean rate in a cell site?",
        "answer": "The busy time mean rate at a cell site is impacted by multiple factors including:\n\n1. User distribution: As the number of active users and their distribution around the cell site increases, the busy time mean rate is observed. More users potentially decrease the mean rate due to increased demand for bandwidth.\n   \n2. Interferences: These interferences could be between radios, carriers, and users. They can affect the signal and in turn, impact the busy time mean rate.\n   \n3. Environmental Factors: The physical location of the cell site, its surroundings, and other sources of interference can affect the signal strength which can influence the busy time mean rate.\n\n4. Packet rate: Different Telecom profiles and packet rate usage also impact the busy time mean rate. Higher packet rates indicate more data being transferred, which can affect the mean rate especially during peak times.\n\n5. Network Topology: The way the network is structured, the positioning of the base station, and how communications are routed, can affect the busy time mean rate.\n\nTransport and radio engineers would need to work together to determine appropriate figures for these factors in different environments, especially in new technologies like 5G."

As the number of UEs and distribution of UE\u2019s around the cell site increases, so the busy time mean rate is seen.

This helps Near-RT RIC to detect which EI types are available in Non-RT RIC and retrieve crucial details about these EI types.\n\nThis EI type information assists Near-RT RIC in creating EI jobs while Non-RT RIC uses it for validating these EI jobs. This information is also utilized by Non-RT RIC to create EI job results, and by Near-RT RIC to validate these results. \n\nNon-RT RIC plays a pivotal part by not only making EI types available but also delivering EI job results to Near-RT RIC.

        "question": "How does O-RAN promote data security, specifically in relation to data storage and authentication mechanisms?",
        "answer": "O-RAN promotes data security with regards to data storage and authentication mechanisms through a number of measures. Firstly, the O-RAN specifications include specific requirements and controls to prevent or at least significantly impede vulnerabilities from being exploited. When it comes to data storage, the requirements call for read access rights to sensitive data in storage to be restricted, and for files required for system functionality to be protected against manipulation.\n\nWhen looking at authentication mechanisms, O-RAN uses systems such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to regulate access. Systems that require access to identification and authentication data do not store this information in clear formats. Instead, they encrypt or scramble it by implementation-specific means. To add another layer of protection, for log-data management, the support of attribute-based access control based on NIST SP800-162 standards should be supported.\n\nThe goal of these measures is not only to authenticate with valid credentials but also to detect and block unauthorized or invalid access attempts. Using attribute-based access control allows operations on objects to be granted or denied based on assigned attributes of the subject and object, environment conditions, and a set policy specified in terms of these aspects. This validates the behavior of the authorization mechanism, ultimately"

The labels \u2018profile- instanceID\u2019 and \u2018queueID\u2019 in the following diagrams denote AAL Profile Instance object handle and identifier of an AAL Profile Queue respectively.\n\nScenario 1: Basic implementation: A HW Accelerator supports a single AAL-LPU which exposes a single AAL-Profile-Instance for one AAL Application to use\n\nFigure 4-1 Scenario 1: A single AAL LPU exposes a single AAL Profile Queue used by a single AAL Application. \nPre-conditions\n\nAt least one AAL-Profile-Instance is configured and started. At least one AAL-Profile-Queue is configured and started.\n\nBegins when\n\nThe AAL Application is ready to receive buffer.\n\nSteps 1-5 (CM)\n\nIn case of with callback, the AAL Application calls the receiveBuffer API to receive buffer content from the AAL which will execute the receive. In the case no buffers are ready to be received the AAL Implementation returns immediately indicating no buffers were received. \nAAL profiles specify one or multiple AFs in specific order offloaded to the HWA. To take advantage of multiple AFs offloaded to the same or different HWAs, the AAL Implementation can permit the chaining of AAL Profile(s) executing the AF or set thereof. In such a case, the AAL Implementation redirects the output of preceding AAL Profile as input to the subsequent AAL Profile belonging to the same or different LPU(s) on the same or different HWA(s). Such a chaining of AAL Profiles allows data to be transferred from one AAL Profile to another AAL Profile without the intervention of the AAL Application thereby reducing transfer latencies. Chained AAL Profile Instances can reside on the \nRelated use\n\nGoal\n\nThe AAL Application sends buffer(s) to the AAL for processing in asynchronous mode with buffer free.\n\nActors and Roles\n\nAAL Application: formats buffer and its content, and calls AAL to send the buffer.\n\nAAL Implementation: executes sendBuffer operation.\n\nAssumptions\n\nThis sequence is representative of how the AAL Application uses the sendBuffer operation in an asynchronous manner with buffer free enabled.\n\nPre-conditions\n\nAt least one AAL-Profile-Instance is configured and started. At least one AAL-Profile-Queue is configured and started. Buffer(s) to be sent are allocated.\n\nBegins when\n\nThe AAL Application is ready to send buffer.",
        "question": "Can you explain what an AAL Profile Queue is and its role in the O-RAN system?",
        "answer": "The AAL Profile Queue in the O-RAN system is an abstract construct that represents data flow. It does not relate to a hardware design specification or requirement. In connection with an AAL-Profile-Instance, its functionality is started and stopped. It appears involved in both sending and receiving buffers and operations associated with this in an O-RAN system, indicating its primary role in data transfer. For instance, in operations like 'receiveBuffer', the AAL Application calls the API to receive buffer content from the AAL, which will execute the receive. In the 'sendBuffer' operations, the AAL Application uses this function in an asynchronous mode with the buffer free enabled. It's also mentioned that the AAL Profile Queue implementation can allow the chaining of AAL Profiles that permit data to be transferred from one AAL Profile to another without the intervention of the AAL Application, thereby reducing transfer latencies.\nThe proper configuration and initiation of the AAL-Profile-Queue and the AAL-Profile-Instance are among the preconditions for these processes."

        "question": "What is the role of xApp's issued certificate in O-RAN's operation?",
        "answer": "The issued certificate for xApp in O-RAN's operation carries the xApp ID in the subjectAltName field, indicating its uniqueness during operation. This certificate is used by the xApp for subsequent authentication and authorization procedures between the xApp and the Near-RT RIC platform when services or resources are accessed by xApps through APIs. This mechanism is necessary for secure data encryption and decryption and for deriving the username of the client by the server or vice versa. The certificate plays an essential role in maintaining secure operation processes in O-RAN's functioning."

Apart from this, with physical access, an attacker can also change the O-RAN component's configuration, impacting the overall working and performance of the network. Control or manipulation of one of the nodes in a network could also lead to distribution of inaccurate timing information causing degradation in the time protocol accuracy resulting in a denial of service (DoS) on all Radios Units (RUs) that rely on accurate time.
